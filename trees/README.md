What is tree and log(n)
what is unbalanced tree
size = total number of nodes
children, parent, siblings
edge = the line between two nodes
height = the max number of edges between the root and the leafs
level = the difference between the height of the root and the node, root level is zero


Types of binary tree:
1 - Complete Binary Tree
2 - Full (Strict) Binary Tree

Implementation:
- linked representation (nodes)
- sequestional representation (array)
